    <p>We try very hard to avoid this sort of problem and we're just as frustrated as you are.

        <a href="/contacts/webguy.htm">contact our webmaster</a> and let him know which link
        is broken.  If the bad link is on another site, please contact their web master.

    <p>All of our pages can be found through the menu on the left side of the page.
